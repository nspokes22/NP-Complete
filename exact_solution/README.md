Problem: Traveling salesman - Given a weighted, undirected, complete graph where each vertex is a city that is connected to each other city by a distance, what is the shortest path you can take to visit each city once and return to the origin city?

Input format: The first item of the first line is the quantity of vertices/cities and the second item of the first line is the start/end node of the cycle. Each other line is the distance from each city to each other city. The sequential index of each line corresponds that specific city, and each distance on that line corresponds to the distance between the current city and the city at that distance's index within the line.
